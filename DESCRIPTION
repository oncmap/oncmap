Description: Medication adherence, defined as medication-taking behavior that aligns with the agreed-upon 
    treatment protocol, is critical for realizing the benefits of prescription medications. 
    Medication adherence can be assessed using electronic adherence monitoring devices (EAMDs), 
    pill bottles or boxes that contain a computer chip that records the date and time of each 
    opening (or “actuation”). Before researchers can use EAMD data, they must apply a series of 
    decision rules to transform actuation data into adherence data. 
    The purpose of this R package ('oncmap') is to transform EAMD actuations in the form of a raw .csv file, 
    information about the patient, regimen, and non-monitored periods into two daily adherence values -- 
    Dose Taken and Correct Dose Taken.
